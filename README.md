# time-tiling-testing
A repository to test loop nest optimizations and particularly time-tiling

Run `make`
and ./a.out `tile_size` (e.g. ./a.out 32 (for `tile_size=32`))

at the end of the execution you will be asked for a name for the csv file containing the results.

Warning : do not change the problem parameters until time buffering is implemented. Soon to be.
